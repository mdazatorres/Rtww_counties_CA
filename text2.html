<h2>Data processing</h2>
<p>We employ two methods to obtain a smoothed wastewater signal and handle outliers, aiming to recover the underlying pattern:
     the trimmed average and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model of order 1.</p>

<h3>Trimmed Average</h3>
<p>We apply a 10-day moving average, which involves calculating the average concentration over a 10-day window while 
    excluding extreme values. This approach helps reduce the impact of outliers and provides a more stable representation
     of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration over time.</p>

<h3>Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)</h3>
<p>To obtain a smoothed concentration signal and capture the underlying pattern of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration, 
    we employ an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model of order 1. The ARIMA model incorporates 
    the autocorrelation by estimating the current concentration based on the concentration at the previous time point. 
    This temporal dependency allows the autoregressive model to provide a smoother representation of the underlying 
    concentration pattern. ARIMA is a popular statistical model used for time series forecasting, combining three key 
    components: autoregression, differencing, and moving average. In this case, we utilize the implementation of ARIMA
     available in the INLA package. INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) is a computational method for Bayesian
      inference that offers a fast and efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. It is particularly 
      useful for models with latent Gaussian structures. The model implemented in INLA can be described as follows:

<p>The autoregressive model of order 1 (AR1) for the Gaussian vector <strong>&#120582; = (&#120583;<sub>1</sub>, &#8943;, &#120583;<sub>n</sub>)</strong> is defined as:</p>
<p>
    &#120583;<sub>1</sub> &sim; &#119911;(0, (&#964;(1 - &#961;<sup>2</sup>))<sup>-1</sup>)<br>
    &#120583;<sub>i</sub> = &#961;&#120583;<sub>i-1</sub> + &#949;<sub>i</sub> ; &emsp; &#949;<sub>i</sub> &sim; &#119911;(0, &#964;<sup>-1</sup>) &emsp; i = 2, &#8943;, n
</p>
<p>where |&#961;| &lt; 1. The parameter &#964; controls the variability or precision of the random variables, while &#961; determines the strength and direction of the correlation between consecutive observations. These parameters are estimated using the data, and the estimated values are used to recover &#120583;<sub>t</sub>.</p>

<p>In our case, we consider &#120583;<sub>t</sub> as the logarithm of the RNA concentration in wastewater. The parameter
     estimation is performed using INLA, and the corresponding R code is as follows:</p>
