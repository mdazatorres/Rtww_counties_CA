<h2>Rt estimations</h2>
<p>We estimate the <em>Rt</em> value, which represents the effective reproduction number, using the smoothed normalized concentration for each county. In addition, we compare it with the <em>Rt</em> estimated using cases and the test positivity rate. The following steps provide a general overview of the process for estimating <em>Rt</em> using wastewater data.</p>

<h3>Wastewater Data Processing</h3>
<ol>
<li>The SARS-CoV-2 viral load is normalized by the PMMoV concentration, resulting in the dimensionless metric N/PMMoV. The N gene is present in all variants of the virus. PMMoV is highly abundant RNA virus detected broadly in wastewater.</li>
<li>Apply two smoothing functions to the normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration to compare the variability of the estimations: a 10-day trimmed average and an autoregressive model of order 1. These smoothing techniques help capture the underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration. For detailed information and a more comprehensive understanding of the data processing steps, please refer to the Data Processing section.</li>

<h3>Computing the Rt</h3>
<section>
<h4>Rt implementation algorithm</h4>
<p>To estimate the effective reproduction number (<em>Rt</em>), we implement the algorithm proposed by Cori et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwt133">2013</a>) using the <a href="https://github.com/lo-hfk/epyestim">Epyestim</a> package available for Python and R. This algorithm requires incidence data and the generation interval. The calculation of <em>Rt</em> is based on the following formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rt = I<sub>t</sub> / ∑<sub>s=1</sub><sup>t</sup> I<sub>t-s</sub> w<sub>s</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, I<sub>t</sub> is the number of new infections on day <em>t</em>, and w<sub>s</sub> is the generation interval, which can be seen as the probability that an infected individual infects others <em>s</em> days after infection.</p>
<p>For COVID-19 in the Epyestim package, the default generation interval is based on the combination of the serial interval distribution (mean: 4.3 days) (Flaxman et al., 2020) and the delay distribution (mean: 10.3 days) (Brauner et al., 2020).</p>

<h4>Estimating Rt for Wastewater: Proxy Case Calculation</h4>
<p>To compute <em>Rt</em> for wastewater data, we utilize a proxy of the cases derived from the smoothed SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration. The process involves dividing the smoothed concentration by the minimum concentration observed in the treatment plant. This normalization step ensures that the minimum concentration corresponds to a value of 1, serving as a reference point.</p>
<p>Next, we multiply the normalized concentration by a scalar value, <em>k</em>, which we set as 4. This assumption implies that the minimum concentration observed in the treatment plant corresponds to approximately 4 infected individuals. The choice of <em>k</em> is not critical for calculating <em>Rt</em> since it is scale-free. Note that if we multiply the incidence series I<sub>1</sub>, ..., I<sub>t</sub> in the above formula by a scalar <em>k</em>, the value of <em>Rt</em> remains unchanged. This scaling factor does not affect the calculation of <em>Rt</em>.</p>
<p>The formula for computing the proxy of cases from wastewater data is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I<sub>ww</sub> = k * (C<sub>RNA</sub> / min(C<sub>RNA</sub>))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, C<sub>RNA</sub> = (C<sub>1</sub>, ..., C<sub>n</sub>) represents the smoothed concentration vector at different time points. By applying this formula, we obtain a proxy of the cases based on the wastewater data.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the selection of the scalar value <em>k</em> can impact the sensitivity of the implementation, especially for low counts. As discussed in Capistrán et al. (2022), the value of <em>k</em> influences the posterior coefficient of variation in the algorithm implemented by Cori et al. (2013):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CV<sub>post</sub> = 1 / √(a + ∑<sub>s=t-τ+1</sub><sup>t</sup> I<sub>s</sub>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, <em>a</em> is the shape parameter for the prior distribution of R<sub>t,τ</sub>. In this case, R<sub>t,τ</sub> is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution with parameters (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>), and it represents the reproductive number in the time period [t-τ+1, t], assuming constant transmissibility.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that low counts can lead to a high coefficient of variation, emphasizing the need to carefully select an appropriate value for <em>k</em> based on the specific characteristics and dynamics of the analyzed wastewater data.</p>

<section>
<p>Once we obtain the estimated I<sub>ww</sub>, we can compute <em>Rt</em> using the Epyestim package.</p>
